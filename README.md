COS426 Possible Areas of Test

2011, Exam2:

1. rendering methods (basic ray tracing, monte carlo path tracing, radiosity, rasterization), what they are and their pros and cons [2007 as well]
2. illumination formula, what each term means and depends on, 
3. application of Snell's Law; ray-tracing assignment tricks (test for light sources in shadow or not)
4. Euler's method & Hooke's law (Euler's method's cons & difficulty)

2010, Exam2:

1. illumination: the relationship of camera post, diffusion, Phone model, 
	degree of freedom? 
	computation formula
2. compare various shaders (Gouraud, etc; use case, speed); 
	triangle/polygon rendering pipeline [2007]
3. recursive ray tracing, how it works, how it provides approximation to the integration of a formula
4. surface parameterization; texture mapping; 
5. animation: dynamics versus kinematics? forward kinematics versus inverse kinematics? space-time constraints? biomechanical model

2009, Exam2:

1. phong lighting equation, its use, justifications for various parts
2. shader (what is Gouraud shading? its pros and cons); z-buffer? 
3. radiosity

2007, Exam2:

1. "trivial reject" examples in rendering; 
2. sampling/aliasing;  dithering; nyquist rate; resampling; bandlimit; (definitions)
	[2011 exam 1 as well]
3. scan conversion (Sweep-line algo to scan convert a single triangle with Gouraud shading and texture mapping, describe how it works)

2006, Exam2:

1. define "Coherence"
2. rendering equation 

2015, Exam1:

1. basic concepts about colors, different color spaces, spectrum, representations, conversions, color models [2007][2006]
2. convolution with image filters; image processing (assignment 1)
	[2013 as well, different filters, know their matrices]
	[2006]
3. parametric curves
4. implicit surface representation versus polygon mesh; BSP tree; 

2013, Exam1:

1. cubic Bezier curve? (have we learnt it?)
2. B-splines; continuity (B-splines ensure C^2 continuity at joints)
	[2010 as well][2009]
3. transformation with 2D matrices (have we learnt it?) [2006]

2011, Exam1:

1. 3D representation: implicit function, triangle mesh, B-spline (pros and cons, what they are, continuity? )
2. half-edge data structures (recall assignment)

2009, Exam1:

1. Image processing (alpha channel and its use and significance)
2. mesh data structure (implementations)

2008, Exam1:

1. sudivision surfaces (mesh representation)

2006, Exam1:

1. Transformations
